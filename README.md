# power-fault-detector-ibm-cloud
A machine learning-based system for detecting and classifying power distribution faults using Random Forest. Built with Python in IBM Watson Studio and deployed on IBM Cloud Lite. The system processes real-time voltage and current phasor data to identify fault types like line-to-ground, line-to-line, and three-phase faults.
